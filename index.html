        <div>Welcome to thenovlist!<br><br></div>

        <div>thenovlist is a W.I.P. Novetus server list by jahoobas.<br><br></div>

        <div>! THIS IS NOT A REVIVAL. DO NOT CALL IT A REVIVAL. !<br><br></div>

        <div>As you can tell, this page is still a work in progress as well. Heres what to expect when the website is completed:</div>
        <ol>
            <li>A list of working servers for Novetus</li>
            <li>A link to the original Novetus page, as this will not use a modified Novetus, but rather the original.</li>
            <li>A way to create your own servers</li>
            <li>A tutorial on how to host a server</li>
            <li>And finally, a way to protect from exploiters (such as an admin script for you to insert if you would like)</li>
        </ol>

        <div>TO ALL SERVER HOSTERS: I do not control any moderation. That is up to you to manage on your own server. I ask that everybody keeps a civil, welcoming community on this site.<br><br></div>

        <div>Have fun in the future, and I respect you.</div>
